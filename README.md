## Memory Speed Visualizer

Saw something similar on Instagram, so I thought it would be fun to recreate myself.

Currently still uses estimates for speeds, will update them when I get a chance to benchmark my own hardware.

**Update:** I found much more accurate benchmarks online of modern consumer-grade hardware.
The current visualizer uses read speeds from AIDA64 benchmarks of the 9950x CPU, 6000MT/s DDR5 RAM, and Q1T1 CDM benches of the 
9100 Pro Gen 5 SSD and Iron Wolf HDD.
